## Report Development Techniques

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Utilized Power Query for data cleaning, transforming, and loading (ETL) processes.
   - Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and formatted data types to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. Data Modeling:
   - Established relationships (one-to-many) between tables to ensure proper data integration and integrity.
   - Created calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced data calculations and analysis.

3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):
   - Used DAX to create calculated measures and columns for aggregating and analyzing data, such as total points earned, race wins, and performance metrics.

4. Field Parameters:
   - Implemented field parameters to allow dynamic switching between different measures and dimensions in visualizations.
   - Enabled users to interactively change the fields displayed in charts and tables interactively, providing a customizable experience.

5. Conditional Formatting:
   - Applied conditional formatting to highlight key data points and trends, making the dashboard visually appealing and easier to interpret.

6. Interactive Elements:
   - Integrated buttons, tooltips, and icons to enhance interactivity and user experience.
   - Used slicers and filters to enable dynamic data exploration and analysis.
